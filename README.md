# Incorporating Measurement Error in Astronomical Object Classification

This repository holds R code for reproducing the results in [Shy et al. (2021+)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06831).

## Toy Example

``toy_source.R`` holds helper functions for both the support-vector machine and random forest implementations. The example data can be reproduced fully using the provided scripts.

## High-_z_ quasars classification

The raw and clean data are available [here](https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sxs1825_psu_edu/EtVh-D0b08ZFqSRymu-c8BoBAdaI-3Fe3z0WOFCZXGmmFw?e=Hch52W). The raw data was acquired as in Timlin et al. (2018) and the clean data was created using the R script ``clean_data.R``.
